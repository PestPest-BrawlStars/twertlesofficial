    <h1>Welcome to the Official Twertles-Brawl Stars club tournament rules, version 1</h1>
    <h3>This is the official rules and regulations page. If the rules change, you can see that here.</h3>
	    <ul>
		    <li>The competition will be held on a random solo showdown map; the maps that will be used will be posted on this site 24hrs or so before day of the competition.</li>
		    <li>It is the sole responsibility of the moderators to ensure that no teaming occurs and that the fight was conducted fairly. Also, recordings of the battle will be posted here for you to download.</li>
		    <li>On the day of the tournament, a friendly game will be held and all those that want to participate will be invited.</li>
		    <li>The formula for points is kills + (10-place) with a 1 point bonus for 3rd place, 2 points for 2nd, and 3 points for first.</li>
		    <li>Five battles will be held, and all points for each player will be summed and the totals compared. The player with the most points is declared winner.</li>
		    <li>The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners' names will be posted here, unless I decide to put that on a seperate webpage.</li>
		    <li>In the case that we use 3v3 modes for the tournament in the future, you will be randomly assigned teammates from the pool of players left. When a team loses, they will be out.</li>
		    <li>More rules are in the works, I just need to brainstorm lols</li>
